1) For project, first Create a Model class as

Employ.java contains 

private variables, getters/setters, constructors, toString() 

2) Need to create an user-defined Exception class, because my code contains user-defined exceptions module. 

EmployException.java this file contains user-defined exceptions. 

public class EmployException extends Exception {

	public EmployException() {}
	
	public EmployException(String error) {
		super(error);
	}
}

3) Then you create an interface EmployDao that which contains what operations are possible in your project. 

As interface is a contract, as once you see that what you did in project will be understandable to all. 

4) Then its time to implement Business Logic, that must be in EmployDaoImpl file, that which implements EmployDao interface. 

now take static variables or objects, because it has to retain the old values. As for list if you add 10 records, all to be added to the same list. 

5) Which is pending is validations...Validations must be in EmployBal file as it is a business layer which contanis validations. 

EmployBal file please call the methods of EmployDaoImpl class. 

6) Now the execution part we need to make 

Create a File as EmployMain, there you please accept input and call the EmployBal class methods.
