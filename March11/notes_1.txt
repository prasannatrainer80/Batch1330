What is the difference between String and StringBuilder 

Strings are immutable, as once they are assigned we cannot alter the values.

StringBuilder is a mutable object, as we can alter the values.

    name 
    gender
    dept
    desig
    basic

1) Add Employ
2) Show Employ
3) Search Employ
4) Update Employ

CRUD 

Validations : 

empno cannot be zero or negative
name contains min 5 chars
gender is MALE or FEMALE
basic must be between 10000 and 90000

If any validation fails then please throw userdefined exception as EmployException 

You need to define what operations are possible in the project, please specify in an interface.

EmployDao as an interface and in that interface Define all the methods,

EmployDaoImpl file contains actual implememntation of existing interface.

After writing the business logic, we need to implement validations to be in EmployBal file as Bal stands for business layer which is responsible for writing vaidations, As Dao file to be called in Bal after validation success.
