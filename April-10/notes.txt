Unit Testing :

What is Testing ???

defect : If tester identifies something known as defect.

bug : If programmer accepts the defect known as bug. 

*** All defects are not bugs, but all bugs are defects ***

error : if programmer identfies something in your code known as error. 

fatal : if client identifies some error known as fatal. 

Manual testing can be done by testers, but unit testing can be done by
developers. 

Unit Testing each and every line needs to be tested successfully, and the 
parameters we need to check here are 

	Code Coverage
	Test Coverage 


We need junit to implement unit testing in java.

We need to create a test-case file, in that we need to write all test cases.

Each test case will be prefixed with @Test annotation. 

test case methods must be void type. 

we have various methods of test cases in java as 

assertEquals()
assertTrue()
assertFalse()
assertArrayEquals()
assertNull()
assertNotNull()
